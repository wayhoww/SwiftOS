Output: write to 0x9000_0000

Read from serial: reading from 0x9000_0000 results in pressed keyboard. But the value won't reset after reading/releasing.

Note that: KEYBOARD AND MONITOR are not involved here. They are simply serial I/O.


> Flash memory starts at address 0x0000_0000
> RAM starts at 0x4000_0000 
> All other information about device locations may change between QEMU versions, so guest code must look in the DTB.
